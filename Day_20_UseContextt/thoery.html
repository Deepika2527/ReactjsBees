PropsDrilling-

propsdrilling 

its a procees where the props are being passed from the 1st componet to the nth copmponents using the intermediates components

CompA-- CompB ---Compc----compD

useContext-
Its a alternative method for propdrilling
its helps the state/data to flow from one compnent to another componenst without using the intermediate childs.


drwback
rendering will happen for the data that is passed



step 1: In the parent Components we need to create a createContext

createContext - create an hold and that stores the data/state.
 

syntax
variable name = createContext - so we need to import createContext from the react


let dataContext = createContext

Step 2:
Twe need to pass the state/data using provider which holda a value attribute


Step 3:
In the child Compoenent we nees to use useContext to receive the data/state
