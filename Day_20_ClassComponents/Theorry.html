 ClassComponents-
 A class component is a way to create a component using a Js class instead of function

 A componnet is reauble UI
 BUTTON
 Nav
 Header
 Footer
 Cards


 Import Points
 import {Components}


 class Welcome extends Component
 {
 
 render() - render the UI {
  return //code  - JSX-UI
 
 }
 
 
 }

 export default Welcome

Without render a class compinet cant work


Why dow e need class Compoents
1.Store the data - state
2. Handle LifeCycle Events
3. Better control -earlier days


render()
This is like a camera where it takes pic of the UI on each update of the Props/state


Constructor-Its is aspecial method thats runs first when the class component is created.
This is used to initilasie the state and bind the methods

ex to hadle 
Construtor(props){
super(props);
this.state =  {
count =0;
name = "Deepika"

}
}

super Keyword:
Used to call the constructor and methods of the parent class


ParentClass - Component
Child Class- Componet we have created

LifeCycle

Mounting: When a component is created and added into the Dom
Order Exection
    Constructor():
        To initalis the state/ bind the events
        to acess this using spuper(props)

    render()-
        Its returns the JSX
        UI waht shul appear


static getDervidedStateFromProps()
        sync state with props
        this is static
        compare the props and the state
componentDidMount()
        Runs after the componet is added to the dom
