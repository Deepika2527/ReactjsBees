Router Dom - React routing Library


what ??
Helps to navigate from one page to another page, without fully reloading the page
 

examples like Intrnship page, Home page, Review page, Contact Page



without react
<a href="#"> Home </a>


with react
<Link to="/"> </Link>

Is react-router-dom  part of react/node?
Its a separte libray we need to install them
npm i react-router-dom

-import { Routes. Route } from "react-router-dom"
+import { Routes } from "react-router"



<BrowserRouter>
</App>
</BrowserRouter>
This will wrap the entire application


<Routes>

</Routes>
This acts like a container which hold the route
<Route/>
This acts like a signborad that helps to define the path of the page
path = "c elements={<Contact/>}
<Link> </Link>
to = "<Routes>"

<Link to = "products/"></Link>
