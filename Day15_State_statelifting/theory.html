useState – Theory Flow

State is a special variable in React that belongs to a component.
It is used to store data that can change over time and automatically update the UI when the value changes.

In normal JavaScript, if we use a variable like let count = 0, the value can change but the UI will not update.
React does not track normal variables.

To solve this problem, React provides useState.

With useState, React:

Stores the value internally

Watches for changes

Re-renders the component when the value updates
Syntax of useState
const [initialValue, updateValue] = useState("value");

State is commonly used for:

Counters,
Form inputs,
Login status,
Cart count,
Toggle (show / hide)

How State Changes (Example Concept)

State can increase or decrease like:

0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5
5 → 4 → 3 → 2 → 1 → 0 → -1

Each time the state value changes, React updates the UI automatically.

useState Syntax – Conceptual Explanation

useState returns two values:

The current state value

A function to update the state

The first value is used to read the state.
The second value is used to change the state.

The value passed inside useState() is called the initial value.

Important Rules of useState

State should never be updated directly
Always use the update function
Updating state causes re-rendering
State updates are asynchronous
Each component manages its own state

State Lifting – Theory Flow

State Lifting means moving state from a Parent component to a Child component.

Instead of keeping separate states in multiple components, we keep one common state in the parent and share it with children.

This is done when:

Multiple components need the same data

One component updates data and another displays it

Child-to-child communication is required

Why State Lifting is Needed

In React:

Data flows only in one direction

Parent → Child is allowed

Child → Child is NOT allowed directly

To share data between children:

State is placed in the parent

Parent passes data to children using props

Children can update the parent state using callback functions
State Lifting Flow (Concept)

Parent component:

Holds the state

Controls the data

Passes state to children

Child components:

Receive data as props

Trigger updates through parent functions

This ensures:

Single source of truth

Better control

Clean data flow
